# Creating Custom Toast

A [Toast](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html) is a message that pops up on the surface of the window. It only fills the amount of space required for the message and the userâ€™s current activity remains visible and interactive. The notification automatically fades in and out, and does not accept interaction events.

Toast is transient notifications that stay visible for less than a few seconds before fading out. Toast donâ€™t take focus and its not a modal, so that they donâ€™t interrupt the application. You can also use it for debugging purpose. A toast provides simple feedback about an operation in a small popup.

Toasts are excellent for informing your users of events without forcing them to open an Activity or browse a Notification. they provide a perfect mechanism for alerting users to events occurring in background Services without interrupting foreground applications. Generally, your application should show Toasts only if one of its Activities is active.
